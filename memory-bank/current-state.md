# Current State

## Implemented features (verified)
- Backend exposes health endpoint and multiple financial metrics endpoints.
- Backend supports filtering by date range, category, operation type, and business type where applicable.
- Backend provides grouped summaries (day/week/month), top categories, period comparison, and alert detection.
- Frontend dashboard fetches /api/metrics and renders:
  - KPI row: total income, total outcome, profit, and profit margin.
  - Income vs outcome line chart.
  - Profit margin percentage chart.
- Loading skeletons and API error state are present in dashboard UI.

## Test coverage status (verified)
- Backend has route-focused tests for:
  - Deterministic mock generation length and sort order.
  - Date filtering behavior (including range edges).
  - Endpoint behavior for health, facets, summary, top categories, comparison, alerts, and B2B/B2C subsets.
- Frontend has utility-focused tests for:
  - KPI computation.
  - Monthly aggregation and chronological ordering.
  - Currency and percent formatting helpers.

## Known gaps inferred from repository evidence
- Frontend currently consumes only /api/metrics; advanced endpoints (facets, summary, top categories, comparison, alerts, B2B/B2C) are not yet integrated in UI flow.
- Data source is mock-generated in backend runtime; no persistent database or external provider integration is present.
- No authentication/authorization layer is implemented.
- No end-to-end tests are present for cross-layer user journeys.
- Backend tests are concentrated in route-level behavior; lower-level unit granularity for helper functions is limited.

## Next priorities
1. Integrate advanced endpoints into frontend interactions (filters, segment toggles, alerts, comparisons).
2. Introduce a real data source abstraction while preserving deterministic test fixtures.
3. Add e2e coverage for key dashboard journeys (load, filter, comparison, error handling).
4. Expand observability and operational safeguards for API failures and schema changes.
5. Add CI guardrails to run frontend lint/tests and backend tests on every change.

## Evidence
- API routes and business logic: backend/app/routes.py.
- API app setup: backend/app/main.py.
- Backend tests: backend/tests/test_routes.py.
- Frontend entry flow and API consumption: frontend/src/App.tsx.
- Frontend utilities and tests: frontend/src/lib/financial-utils.ts, frontend/src/lib/financial-utils.test.ts.
- Frontend model contract: frontend/src/lib/financial-types.ts.
